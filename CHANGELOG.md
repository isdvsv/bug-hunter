# Changelog

## 2026-03-08

### Changed
- **Sequential-first orchestration**: Parallel mode now uses one authoritative deep Hunter with optional read-only triage; Extended/Scaled modes now run chunked sequential scans with resume state.
- **Fix behavior control**: Phase 2 now runs by default after confirmed findings, with `--scan-only` as explicit report-only opt-out.
- **Fix pipeline safety**: Single-writer sequential fixer flow, checkpoint commits per bug, targeted verify before full verify, explicit `FIX_BASE_COMMIT` for post-fix diff.
- **Preflight reliability**: Dynamic `SKILL_DIR` resolution and non-blocking Context7 availability checks (missing API key no longer blocks runs).
- **Portability**: Prompt doc-lookup commands now use `"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/context7-api.cjs"` instead of hardcoded home paths.
- **Fixture consistency**: Self-test expectations aligned to 6 planted bugs across SKILL docs and evals.
- **Stash handling clarity**: Docs and pipeline now describe automatic stash restore attempt with conflict reporting.
- **Context7 helper robustness**: Added request timeout handling in `scripts/context7-api.cjs`.
- **Operational scripts**: Added `scripts/bug-hunter-state.cjs`, `scripts/payload-guard.cjs`, and `scripts/fix-lock.cjs` for state/cache management, spawn payload validation, and single-writer locking.
- **Cross-CLI orchestration**: Added `AGENT_BACKEND` selection/fallback model (`spawn_agent -> subagent -> team -> local-sequential`) so runs adapt to different coding CLI capabilities.
- **Executable orchestrator**: Added `scripts/run-bug-hunter.cjs` to run chunk workflows with backend selection, per-phase timeout/retry/backoff, and append-only run journal (`.claude/bug-hunter-run.log`).
- **Confidence gating**: Auto-fix now explicitly targets only high-confidence bugs and leaves lower-confidence findings for manual review.
- **Failure-path coverage**: Expanded eval scenarios for resume flows, hash cache skips, lock contention, payload guard failures, and confidence-gated fixes.
- **Script reliability tests**: Added `scripts/tests/*` to validate `bug-hunter-state`, `payload-guard`, `fix-lock`, and `run-bug-hunter` behavior.
- **Persistent index upgrade**: `scripts/code-index.cjs` now captures symbols, relative-import dependency graph, lightweight call graph, trust-boundary tags, and bug-scoped query commands.
- **Delta-first scope**: Added `scripts/delta-mode.cjs` for changed-files + dependency-hop selection with critical overlay expansion candidates.
- **Runner wiring**: `scripts/run-bug-hunter.cjs` now supports `--use-index`, `--delta-mode`, low-confidence expansion, chunk fact-card capture, global consistency reporting, and canary-first fix-plan generation.
- **State schema v2**: `scripts/bug-hunter-state.cjs` now tracks confidence, low-confidence metrics, chunk fact cards, consistency payload, fix plan, and supports file-appending for expansion passes.
- **Hybrid pipeline tests**: Added coverage for code indexing, delta selection/expansion, delta-runner expansion flow, fact-card persistence, consistency output, and canary subset planning.
- **Autonomous trigger clarity**: Added `--autonomous` path in docs (forces fix mode with canary-first flow) to avoid "report-only then ask" behavior in unattended runs.
- **False-positive control**: Added mandatory verification re-audit gate in skill flow so contradicted/non-reproducible findings are rejected before final confirmed counts.
- **Default fix behavior**: Switched to fix-by-default workflow; `--scan-only` now explicitly disables Phase 2 and keeps report-only mode.
- **README refresh**: Rewrote README in a consistent pattern aligned to default-fix flow, hybrid index+delta pipeline, re-audit gate, and canary-first remediation.

## 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Auto-fix pipeline** (`--fix`): Parallel Fixers in isolated git worktrees, checkpoint commits, test verification, auto-revert on regression, post-fix re-scan
- **Loop mode** (`--loop`): Iterates until 100% coverage, tracks state in checksummed coverage files
- **Combined fix-loop** (`--loop --fix`): Find, fix, and verify until clean
- **Staged file mode** (`--staged`): Scan staged files as a pre-commit check
- **Recon agent**: Maps architecture, trust boundaries, and computes dynamic context budget
- **Dual-lens Hunters**: Security Hunter + Logic Hunter scan in parallel with different focuses
- **Security checklist sweep**: Mandatory per-file pass in Hunter for hardcoded secrets, JWT expiry, input validation, auth gaps, data exposure
- **Context7 doc verification**: Verifies library/framework behavior claims against real documentation
- **Modular architecture**: SKILL.md split into slim core + mode files loaded on demand
- **Preflight checks**: Validates Context7 API key and Node.js availability at startup
- **Self-test fixture**: Express app with 6 planted bugs for pipeline validation
- **Portability**: All paths use `~/.claude/skills/bug-hunter`, Context7 script bundled in `scripts/`

### Changed
- Extended and Scaled modes for larger codebases (41-80 and 81-120 files)
- Skeptic directory clustering for efficient file reads
- Referee re-check pass for high-severity Skeptic disproves
- Evidence anchoring: Hunter must quote exact code; Referee spot-checks quotes

## 2026-03-05

- Added branch diff mode: `/bug-hunter -b <branch> [--base <base>]`
## 2026-03-05 -- Initial Release

- 3-agent adversarial bug hunting (Hunter, Skeptic, Referee)
- Supports scanning full project, specific directories, or individual files
