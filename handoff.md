# Handoff

## Current status

- Advanced the structured-output migration from
  `docs/plans/2026-03-11-structured-output-migration-plan.md`.
- Landed the main contract migration slices:
  - added `schemas/*.schema.json` for recon, findings, skeptic, referee,
    coverage, fix-report, and shared definitions
  - added `scripts/schema-runtime.cjs` and `scripts/schema-validate.cjs`
  - updated `payload-guard.cjs` to use real schema refs
  - updated `bug-hunter-state.cjs` to reject malformed findings and persist
    canonical `confidenceScore` metadata
  - updated `run-bug-hunter.cjs` to fail and retry chunks when `findings.json`
    is missing or schema-invalid
  - added canonical `coverage.json` output plus derived `coverage.md`
  - added `scripts/render-report.cjs` for report/coverage Markdown rendering
  - updated Hunter/Skeptic/Referee/Fixer prompts to JSON-first output contracts
  - updated major mode docs, SKILL, README, eval text, and wrapper template to
    point at canonical JSON artifacts
  - added `run-bug-hunter.cjs phase` so Skeptic, Referee, and Fixer artifacts
    get orchestrated schema validation with retry support
  - updated worker fixtures and tests for the canonical findings contract
- The structured-output migration plan is effectively complete; the remaining
  follow-up is only secondary doc cleanup where old `*.md` artifact wording may
  still appear in historical text.

## Last prompts

- "2026-03-11-structured-output-migration-plan.md"
- "read this and start working on it"
- "Remaining plan work is the bigger second half: prompt migration, rendered Markdown-from-JSON, coverage.json, and eval/doc alignment.- can we launch parallel team agents /subagents and work on loop until task is done?"
- "fix these as well"
- "continue"

## Verification

- `node --test scripts/tests/payload-guard.test.cjs scripts/tests/bug-hunter-state.test.cjs scripts/tests/run-bug-hunter.test.cjs`
- `node --test scripts/tests/*.test.cjs`

Both passed on 2026-03-11.

## Next steps

- sweep remaining secondary docs for stale `*.md` phase-artifact references
- decide whether `run-bug-hunter.cjs phase` should be documented in README or
  kept as an internal orchestration helper only

## Environment

- Working directory: `/Users/codex/.agents/skills/bug-hunter`
- Node: `v22.22.0`
- Backend used for the tests: `local-sequential`
